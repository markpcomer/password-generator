# password-generator

This project is a randomized password. Any client that requires password protection would find this to be a simple and clear solution. A user can, through a short series of pop-ups, choose parameters for their potential password. Their options include number of characters, as well as choices of uppercase letters, lower case letters, numbers, as well as special characters. After the selection process, the generated password is shown in both an alert window, as well as the text field.

This project expanded my knowledge of Javascript funtions, methods, and conditionals.
